## WireFrames and UX design

### Design thought process
My thought process on the general design of the website was to keep it simple. 

Using a black header and footer to frame the content as well as contrasting with the navigation and social links well. 

The header and footer have been kept consistent throughout scrren sizes with the only difference being the burger menu on small screens. 

Naviagtion between the pages to be done using the links contained in the header with the current page highlighted so the user knows what page they're on.

When hovering over any links the background changes color for visual clarity on what the user is mousing over when on desktop.

## Features

### Features in all pages
The header features a burger icon on mobile devices that opens a navigation menu to direct users to the other pages. with the current page being highlighted in inverse colors to the rest of the menu.
On larger devices the links to the other pages are displayed on the left of the page again with the current page being highlighted in inverse colors to the header. 
The name of the company in the header will also link back to the home page from any of the other 3 pages.
