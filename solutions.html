            <h3>Time tracking</h3>
            <p>Our clockcard management allows employees and managers to accurately track their working hours, working in conjuction with our clock machines or web/mobile clocking. 
                This reduces admin questions and gives employees more agency to track the hours they work.</p>
            <p>Managers are also able to amend the clockcards of their employees as needed to approve any over time that was worked, add any leave or absences that may have occured or add any premiums to shifts.</p>
            <h3>Roster management and scheduling</h3>
            <p>Managers can view the full roster for their team and make amendments as neccessary. Schedules can be set to alert the manager if a shift has less people than required or more than needed.</p>
            <p>Managers can also put out a shift swap notice giving their team the opputunity to volunteer for extra shifts or to swap them around. </p>
            <h3>HR management</h3>
            <p>Our product offers a centralized area for all HR related information. From employees details, ensuring compliance or reporting on trends within the company.</p>
            <p>These features can be critical to allowing HR to have a broad overview of the company without spending hours collecting data from different systems. Any reports needed are more than likely built
                in and we also offer custom report building to fulfil any need HR may have.</p>
            <h3>Skills management and documentation</h3>
            <p>We offer a skill manager and employee documentation on their personell page. These can be configured to expire and alert managers when refresher training is needed. Certificates from any training courses 
                can be uploaded to their profile to keep everything in the one place. </p>
            <p>As well as these we have skills integrated with our scheduler if it is required that a certain amount of employees need to have a certain type of training while on shift to by compliant with your own policies
                or any regulating bodies.</p>
